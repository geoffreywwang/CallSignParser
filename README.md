# Call Sign Parser

This project is to parse the FCC ULS amateur radio database file for available call signs.

Target database is the `HD.dat` file found in the weekly database for Amateur Radio Service Licenses ([link](https://www.fcc.gov/uls/transactions/daily-weekly)). Database can be downloaded directly [link](https://data.fcc.gov/download/pub/uls/complete/l_amat.zip). 

Put the `HD.dat` file into this folder. Install the `dateutil` package.
